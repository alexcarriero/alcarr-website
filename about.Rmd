### Introduction

Hi, I'm Alex! I'm a Master's student at Utrecht University studying Methodology and Statistics.  I plan to graduate in June 2023 and look forward to applying my statistical knowledge and programming skills to projects arising in medical domains.   

Currently I am focused on my Master's thesis.  For my thesis, I aim to determine the best practices for handling class imbalance (without compromising model calibration) when developing clinical prediction models for dichotomous risk prediction. The project is based at the [Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care](https://juliuscentrum.umcutrecht.nl/en) at [University Medical Center Utrecht](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/) under the supervision of [Dr. Maarten van Smeden](http://mvansmeden.net/), [Dr. Kim Luijken]() and [Dr. Ben Van Calster](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/ben-van-calster#tab-1).

During my time in Guelph I selected a degree program that gave me great flexibility to choose between studying Mathematics and Biomedical Science.  After taking a wide range of courses in both departments (e.g., Advanced Calculus, Applied Differential Equations, Physiology, Epidemiology), I discovered that I love statistics.  Statistics was the perfect way for me to merge my interests in mathematics and medicine. So, in my final few years at Guelph, I took every statistics course I could enroll in. My favorite course was Statistical Computing.\
\
For my Bachelor's thesis I completed a project in the statistics department with [Dr. Gerarda Darlington](https://mathstat.uoguelph.ca/people/darlington).  In this project, I coded a simulation study to compare statistical methods for modelling clustered data in the presence of small cluster
sizes.\
