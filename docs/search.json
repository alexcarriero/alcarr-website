I plan to graduate in June 2023 and look forward to applying my statistical knowledge and programming skills to projects arising in a medical domain.\nCurrently I am focused on my Master’s thesis. For my thesis, I aim to determine the best practices for handling class imbalance (without compromising model calibration) when developing clinical prediction models for dichotomous risk prediction. The project is based at the Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care at the University Medical Center Utrecht under the supervision of Dr. Maarten van Smeden, Dr. Kim Luijken and Dr. Ben Van Calster\nEducation\n\n\n\n\n MSc. Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences \nIn progress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n BSc. Physical Sciences \nDuring my time in Guelph I selected a degree program that gave me great flexibility to choose between studying Mathematics and Biomedical Science. After taking a wide range of courses in both departments (e.g., Advanced Calculus, Applied Differential Equations, Physiology, Epidemiology), I discovered that I love statistics. Statistics was the perfect way for me to merge my interests in mathematics and medicine. So, in my final few years at Guelph, I took every statistics course I could enroll in. My favorite course was Statistical Computing.\nFor my Bachelor’s thesis I completed a project in the statistics department with Dr. Gerarda Darlington. In this project, I coded a simulation study to compare statistical methods for modelling clustered data in the presence of small cluster\nsizes. GPA: 4.0 \n\n\n\n\n\n",
